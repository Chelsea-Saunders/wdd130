it associates the label with the form control, enabling mouse, trackpad,

<!-- To define the default value of an <input> element you have to use the 
value attribute like this: 
<input type="text" value="by default this element is filled with this text" />

<!-- On the other hand, if you want to define a default value for a <textarea>, 
you put it between the opening and closing tags of the <textarea> element, 
like this: 
<textarea>
by default this element is filled with this text

                <p>Here at NaiNai Leather & Creations, we offer unprecedented and 
                    hand-crafted leatherwork and custom graphic designs. Have you 
                    ever gone to a craft show and been drawn into the beautiful 
                    leather, hand-made items? They all claimed to be hand crafted 
                    and unique. But have you ever picked up a piece and look it 
                    over and thought, "No doubt it was beautiful but it was 
                    obvious to even an untrained eye that this is most definitely 
                    NOT hand crafted"? Well, perhaps the staining or painting was 
                    authentic but the actual leatherwork wasn't. Then, you flipped 
                    the tag over and had to pick your jaw up off the floor, seeing 
                    the astronomical prices? Yes, the piece was real leather but 
                    the bragged about handtooling wasn't and they were pricing it 
                    as if it were. Knowing what lifeâ€™s like on a farm, and 
                    understanding the reality of having to scrimp for good quality 
                    stuff but also knowing how important it is to have good, 
                    long-lasting quality, and having been raised around leather 
                    work but never had time to get into it seriously, got me 
                    thinking, I wonder if I could make high-quality, hand-crafted 
                    items for a reasonable price. After a few years of practicing, 
                    people started noticing the quality and uniqueness and wanted 
                    me to make stuff for them and NaiNai Leather & Creations was 
                    born. The love making a genuine product that are strikingly 
                    beautiful, with unmatched designs all while keeping it at a 
                    price that the honest hard-working American can afford.</p>
