<!-- Using FOR instead of id: 
it associates the label with the form control, enabling mouse, trackpad, 
and touch device users to click on the label to activate the corresponding 
control, and it also provides an accessible name for screen readers to read 
out to their users. -->

<!-- To define the default value of an <input> element you have to use the 
value attribute like this: 
<input type="text" value="by default this element is filled with this text" />
-->

<!-- On the other hand, if you want to define a default value for a <textarea>, 
you put it between the opening and closing tags of the <textarea> element, 
like this: 
<textarea>
by default this element is filled with this text
</textarea>

                <p>When ask what other products people would like to see 
                available, there were many remarks on wanting clothing items 
                that depict the real western lifestyles of the customer 
                without requiring them to change or settle for cookie-cutter, 
                factory produced products available in bulk. From this, NaiNai 
                Leather & Creations started a graphics line. Unlike many 
                graphic companies who simply copy and paste an image off the 
                internet, NaiNai Leather & Creations sees an image or takes a 
                picture of a scene then, goes home and creates the image from 
                scratch and ends up with digital creations that are truly one 
                of a kind. These graphics are then printed onto any number of 
                materials, giving not only unique styles of clothing but also 
                unprecedented images on the clothing. If you are looking for 
                something that is one of a kind, hand crafted from scratch, 
                and that will be the talk of…well, wherever you’ll be, and 
                that won’t leave a hole in your wallet, this is where you need 
                to shop. NaiNai’s takes custom orders on just about anything 
                and gives you your money’s worth and then some.</p>
