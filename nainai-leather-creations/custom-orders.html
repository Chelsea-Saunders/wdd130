<!-- for == id == # -->
<!-- Using FOR instead of id: 
it associates the label with the form control, enabling mouse, trackpad, 
and touch device users to click on the label to activate the corresponding 
control, and it also provides an accessible name for screen readers to read 
out to their users. -->

<!-- To define the default value of an <input> element you have to use the 
value attribute like this: 
<input type="text" value="by default this element is filled with this text" />
-->

<!-- On the other hand, if you want to define a default value for a <textarea>, 
you put it between the opening and closing tags of the <textarea> element, 
like this: 
<textarea>
by default this element is filled with this text
</textarea>
