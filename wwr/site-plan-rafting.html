    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Here at the Dry Oar we want to make our business available to those in all walks of life
        who wish to go rafting. This site allows you to see your options and get a feel
        for what type of rafting and what equiptment you'd like to try before purchasing your own.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>This site is geared towards the "outdoorsy person". Such person will want it to feel like it's 
        outdoorsy but possibly including water and trees/greenery colors as that is usually the theme 
        of someone rafting. Simple but catchy fonts and more nuteral colors that are calm and inviting 
        and this should be made available for all devices.

    <hr /><!--Not happy with the size of the logo. Maybe make it again? learn to resize it or else use a premade one.-->
