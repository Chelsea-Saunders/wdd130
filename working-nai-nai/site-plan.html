        Here at NaiNai Leather & Creations, we offer unprecedented and 
        hand-crafted leatherwork and custom graphic designs.

        Have you ever gone to a craft show and been drawn into the beautiful 
        leather, hand-made items? They all claimed to be hand crafted and unique. 
        But have you ever picked up a piece and look it over and thought, "No doubt it was 
        beautiful but it was obvious to even an untrained eye that this is most 
        definitely NOT hand crafted"? Well, perhaps the staining or painting was authentic 
        but the actual leatherwork wasn't. Then, you flipped the tag over 
        and had to pick your jaw up off the floor, seeing the astronomical prices?  
        Yes, the piece was real leather but the bragged about handtooling wasn't 
        and they were pricing it as if it were. Knowing what life’s like on a farm, 
        and understanding the reality of having to scrimp for good quality stuff but 
        also knowing how important it is to have good, long-lasting quality, and 
        having been raised around leather work but never had time to get into it 
        seriously, got me thinking, I wonder if I could make high-quality, 
        hand-crafted items for a reasonable price. After a few years of practicing, 
        people started noticing the quality and uniqueness and wanted me to make stuff 
        for them and NaiNai Leather & Creations was born. The love making a genuine 
        product that are strikingly beautiful, with unmatched designs all while keeping 
        it at a price that the honest hard-working American can afford.

      <h3>Graphic Prints</h3>
      <p>
        When ask what other products people would like to see available, 
        there were many remarks on wanting clothing items that depict the 
        real western lifestyles of the customer without requiring them to 
        change or settle for cookie-cutter, factory produced products available in bulk. 
        From this, NaiNai Leather & Creations started a graphics line. 
        Unlike many graphic companies who simply copy and paste an image 
        off the internet, NaiNai Leather & Creations sees an image or takes 
        a picture of a scene then, goes home and creates the image from scratch 
        and ends up with digital creations that are truly one of a kind. 
        These graphics are then printed onto any number of materials, 
        giving not only unique styles of clothing but also unprecedented 
        images on the clothing.  If you are looking for something that is 
        one of a kind, hand crafted from scratch, and that will be the 
        talk of…well, wherever you’ll be, and that won’t leave a hole in 
        your wallet, this is where you need to shop. NaiNai’s takes custom 
        orders on just about anything and gives you your money’s worth and 
        then some.
