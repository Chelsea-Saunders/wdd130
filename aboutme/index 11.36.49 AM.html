    <h2>Chelsea</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Chelsea. I grew up in the mountains of eastern Washington, near the Canadian border.
         My parents moved to eastern Oregon just a week before I left
        on my mission to the Philippines. I came home to a lot of changes. There, I met my husband  
        of 17 years. We have 4 wild kids and now live in Idaho.
    </p>
    <p>Five years ago my husband had some health concerns which made to me realize
        if something were to happen to him, I have no way to support myself or my children
        so I decided as soon as my youngest started school, I would 
        get the degree I hadn't finish before getting married. So, here I am!
    </p>
    <p>I am nervous for this semester because, while I did well on my class last semester, 
        at the 5th and 6th week mark of the block class, I was putting in 40+
        hours a week for the one class. It was super stressful on me and my family. However, 
        I've learned a lot and am excited to continue my education in Computer and Web Design.
